<h1>AHHHHH A SNAKE!</h1>
<body>
  <p>
    Getting started on snake, lets make a list of the things we will need to do.
    <pre>
    - move around with arrows/wasd/mouse/gamepad,
    - keep moving whether an input has been entered or not,
    - we only need a left and right controller input,
    - we need food for our baby snake to grow into a healthy, well-balanced member of snake-society,
    - food must spawn randomly about the level
    - snake must grow when it eats the food
    - we want a little scoring system, timer atleast
    - perhaps even push the boat out with levels/difficulties
    </pre>
    </p>
  <h4>How on earth are we supposed to do this?</h4>
  <p>
    Lets break it down into our different classes.
    1. Snake
    2. Food
    3. UI
