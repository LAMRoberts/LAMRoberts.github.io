<h1>AHHHHH A SNAKE!</h1>
<p>
  Getting started on snake, lets make a list of the things we will need to do.
  <ul>
    <li>Move around with arrows/wasd/mouse/gamepad</li>
    <li>keep moving whether an input has been entered or not</li>
    <li>we only need a left and right controller input</li>
    <li>we need food for our baby snake to grow into a healthy, well-balanced member of snake-society</li>
    <li>food must spawn randomly about the level</li>
    <li>snake must grow when it eats the food</li>
    <li>we want a little scoring system, timer atleast</li>
    <li>perhaps even push the boat out with levels/difficulties</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  <h4>How on earth are we supposed to do this?</h4>
<p>
  Lets break it down into our different classes.
  <ul>
    <li>Snake</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>UI</li>
    <li>Options</li>
  </ul>
