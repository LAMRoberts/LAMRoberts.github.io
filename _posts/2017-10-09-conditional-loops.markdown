C++ offers several simple and easy ways to loop. Loops can be used to process the same logic a number of times. The most common is the for loop, followed by while and the do-while. These loops are known as conditional because they continue to loop until a specific condition is met. 

#### The for Loop ####
----

FOR the duration of the time that i is less than 10, iterate logic in loop

{% highlight c++ %}

for( int i=0; i<10; ++i )
{
  // Logic goes here...
}

{% endhighlight %}

As you can see it's basic usage is simple and easy to reason. 

#### The while Loop ####

WHILE
