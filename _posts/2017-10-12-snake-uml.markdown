  Lets get a UML together for snake but i'll need more detail on what the game needs to do.
  The terrible breakdown of the previous post only covers general ideas, so having looked at a 
  few different snake games (links below) lets get together a comprehensivelist to make the UML.
  <ul>
  <li>A playable area where if the snake touches the edge its game over.
  <li>A snake made up of two parts: the head and n body parts where n is the number of apples eaten.
  <li>The head continuously moves forward and can turn left or right relative to the snakes forward direction.
  <li>Each body part simply follows the previous body part.
  <li>Apples that randomly generate one at a time in a random location for the snake to eat.
  <li>When the snake eats an apple the length of the snake and the score goes up by one.
  <li>When an apple is eaten it appears to stay where it is in the grid, but travels down the snake as it moves.
  <li>When an apple gets to the last body part it turns into a body part that follows like the rest of them.
  <li>If the snake touches the wall or one of its body parts the snake stops and the game is over.
  </ul>
